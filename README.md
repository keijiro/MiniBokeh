MiniBokeh is a lightweight depth-of-field effect for Unityâ€™s Universal
Render Pipeline (URP).

Instead of sampling a camera depth texture, MiniBokeh models scene depth with
a single reference plane. It assumes content lies on or near that plane, which
makes it a good fit for planar scenes such as tabletop games, card games, or
top-down strategy titles, and less suitable for general 3D scenes.

It uses efficient separable blurs and provides two variants:

- Hexagonal Separable Filter (L. McIntosh et al.) [1]
- Circular Separable Convolution Depth of Field (K. Garcia) [2]
